<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>
In order to download <i>libtins</i>, please visit project's github
<a href="https://github.com/mfontanini/libtins">
page</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is highly recommended that you download the latest source code so
you are less likely to encounter bugs and you will have access to more
features. Using the following links you can download it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://github.com/mfontanini/libtins/archive/master.tar.gz">tar.gz</a> format.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://github.com/mfontanini/libtins/archive/master.zip">Zip</a> format.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Or clone the git repository by executing:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/mfontanini/libtins.git
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="download-binary">Download binary/precompiled distributions</h3>

<p>
There are some precompiled versions of the library that you can download
so you don't have to compile it yourself.
</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>
The library is automatically built after every commit to the master branch on
Windows using the <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/">appveyor platform</a>
</p>
<p>
You can get the the latest version of the <i>Windows</i> binary package, 
compiled using <i>Visual Studio 2013</i>, 
<a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mfontanini/libtins/branch/master">here</a>.
You can pick between a 32 and 64 bits build, using debug or release mode 
(make sure to pick the right one or you'll get linker errors if you compile your
code in debug mode and try to link with <i>libtins</i> compiled in release mode).
</p>
<p>You will find the appropriate <i>.zip</i> file inside the "artifacts" tab.</p>
<p>
In order to use it, just unpack the package into a directory and then
add the <i>include</i> folder into your application's include 
directories, and add the <i>tins.lib</i> file as a linker dependency.
</p>
<p>
Please have a look at the <a href="#using-windows">using on 
<i>Windows</i></a> section and see some notes on how to use it.
</p>

<h4>OSX</h4>

<p>
You can install the latest version of <i>libtins</i> (3.3) on <i>OSX</i>
using <i>homebrew</i>:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
homebrew install libtins
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="requirements">Compilation requirements</h3>

<p>
<i>libtins</i> depends on both, 
<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org"><i>libpcap</i></a> and 
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/"><i>libcrypto</i></a>. The latter  
is provided by the <i>OpenSSL</i> library and it is only required if 
you want to allow WPA2 decryption. This feature can be disabled by 
using <i>-DLIBTINS_ENABLE_WPA2=0</i> while executing <i>CMake</i>.
</p>
<p>
Since version <i>3.1</i>, <i>libtins</i> started using 
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> as its build system. 
Therefore, you also need it in order to compile the library. 
</p>
<p>
You should be able to install both libraries and <i>CMake</i> through 
your distribution's package manager.
</p>
<p>
For <b>Debian</b> based systems(<i>Ubuntu</i>, <i>Linux Mint</i>, etc), 
you can install them by executing this command as <b>root</b>:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install libpcap-dev libssl-dev cmake
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
For <b>Red Hat</b> based systems(<i>RHEL</i>, <i>Fedora</i>, 
<i>CentOS</i>, etc), you can install them by executing the following 
command as <b>root</b>:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
yum install libpcap-devel openssl-devel cmake
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
For <b>Windows</b>, you can download binary distribution of 
<i>CMake</i> 
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">from their 
website</a>. You should do the same for <i>OpenSSL</i> if you want
to enable <i>WPA2</i> decryption support.
</p>
<p>
You should also <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/">download the 
<i>WinPCAP</i> developer package</a>, which is the <i>Windows</i> 
version of <i>libpcap</i>. 
</p>
<h3 id="compiling">Compiling <i>libtins</i> on <i>Linux/BSD/OSX</i></h3>
<p>
Now you've got everything you need for compiling <i>libtins</i>.
In order to compile, just execute the following commands:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
If you want to enable C++11 support(many non-copyable classes will 
be movable, plus, it will run faster), use the 
<i>-DLIBTINS_ENABLE_CXX11=1</i> switch:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cmake ../ -DLIBTINS_ENABLE_CXX11=1
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now you've compiled the library. The shared object will be located in 
the <i>.libs</i> directory. If you want to install <i>libtins</i> in the 
default include and library path, so you can use it easily in your 
applications, run this command as <b>root</b>:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
make install
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This will tipically install the shared objects in <i>/usr/local/lib</i>
and the header files in <i>/usr/local/include</i>.
</p>
<p>
Note that unless you want to restart your system before using the library,
you'll probably need to update <i>ldconfig</i>'s cache, by issuing:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
ldconfig
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="compiling-windows">Compiling <i>libtins</i> on <i>Windows</i></h3>

<p>
Compiling <i>libtins</i> on <i>Windows</i> has been made easy since 
version <i>3.1</i>. The next steps asume you are using 
<i>Visual Studio</i>, and you have installed both <i>CMake</i>
and the <i>Winpcap</i> developer pack.
</p>
<p>
First, open a console (<i>cmd.exe</i>, <i>git bash</i>, <i>MSYS</i>,
any will do) and <i>cd</i> into the directory in which <i>libtins</i>
sources are located. Now execute the following commands, using the 
path to the <i>WinPCAP</i> developer pack:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir build
cd build
# Replace with the WinPCAP developer pack path
# This disables WPA2 decryption.
cmake ../ -DPCAP_ROOT_DIR=PathTo_WinPCAP_DevPack -DLIBTINS_ENABLE_WPA2=0 -DLIBTINS_BUILD_SHARED=0
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Now, this will have generated a <i>Visual Studio</i> solution. You have 
to choices:
</p>
<h4>Compiling using <i>Visual Studio</i></h4>

<p>
The first one is to open the generated solution and compile it from
<i>Visual Studio</i>. In order to do so, open the file 
<i>build/libtins.sln</i>. Then select the "<i>tins</i>" project, and 
build it. You might want to compile in <i>Release</i> mode, which can 
be selected from the <i>Build</i> menu.
</p>

<h4>Compiling using <i>CMake</i></h4>

<p>
You can also compile directly using <i>CMake</i>. The only drawback here
is that you can't select a <i>Release</i> mode compilation. If you 
are okay with this, execute:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cmake --build .
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The generated <i>.lib</i> file will be in <i>build/lib/Debug/</i>.
</p>

<p>
Despite the compilation method you used, you should have a look at the
<a href="#using-windows">notes</a> on using <i>libtins</i> on 
<i>Windows</i>.
</p>

<h3 id="using">Using <i>libtins</i></h3>

<p>
Once you have compiled <i>libtins</i>, using it is just as simple as
including the appropriate headers and linking against it.
</p>

<h4>Headers</h4>
<p>
<i>libtins</i>' headers are inside a directory named <i>tins</i>, inside
your default include directory. You can include individual headers, or
just <code>#include &lt;tins/tins.h&gt;</code>, which will include all of them.
</p>

<h4>Linking</h4>
<p>
In order to link your application with <i>libtins</i> on <i>GCC</i> or 
<i>clang</i>, use the <i>-ltins</i> flag:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
g++ app.cpp -o app -ltins
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="using-windows">Using <i>libtins</i> on <i>Windows</i></h3>

<p>
If you are using a static build of <i>libtins</i> on <i>Windows</i>, 
then you have link your application with <i>tins.lib</i>. You also need to
add this macro definition to your project:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
TINS_STATIC
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This will make your project use <i>libtins</i> without trying to import
symbols from a DLL but from the static library.
</p>

<p>
You will also need to include the following linker dependencies on your 
project: 
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Ws2_32.lib
Iphlpapi.lib
wpcap.lib
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The first two will be found by the compiler, so you don't need to 
provide a full path. The latter is <i>WinPCAP</i>'s static library, 
which comes with the developers pack.
</p>
