<h3>Traceroute</h3>
</div>

<p>
This is a little traceroute application. It can detect at most 10 hops,
and it might not detect those of them which take too much to answer
(or those which suffer from some packet loss). Of course this could be
enhanced, but it is just a simple example.
</p>
<p>
This example uses features from the C++11 standard, so in order to 
compile it you'll have to use a relatively new compiler. GCC >= 4.6
and clang >= 3.1 should be able to compile it.
