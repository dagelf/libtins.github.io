<p>
This example sniffs beacons on a wireless interface in monitor mode, 
and prints the <i>SSID</i> of every access point that supports <i>WPS</i>.
</p>
<p>
This is useful if you are trying to detect access points that might 
be vulnerable to attacks carried out by tools such as 
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/">reaver</a>.
